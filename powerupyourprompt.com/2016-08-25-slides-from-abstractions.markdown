Hello again! The slides from the [talk I gave at Abstractions](http://abstractions.io/schedule/#session-full-19) are now online! I've posted them up on Speaker Deck: [Power Up Your Prompt!](https://speakerdeck.com/sdball/power-up-your-prompt). I hope you find them useful!

But that's not all! Since you're wonderful blog readers here's all the tools I mentioned in the talk with handy dandy links:

- [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) (parse JSON)
  - `brew install jq`
- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
  - `brew install zsh-autosuggestions`
- [vitetris](http://www.victornils.net/tetris/)
  - `brew install vitetris`
- [fasd](https://github.com/clvv/fasd)
  - `brew install fasd`
- [no more secrets](https://github.com/bartobri/no-more-secrets)
  - `brew install no-more-secrets`
- [log-ninja](https://github.com/mrmanc/log-ninja)
  - Clone the repo and copy the scripts to your PATH. (Confused? A blog post is coming!)
- [csvfix](http://neilb.bitbucket.org/csvfix/)
  - `brew install csvfix`
- [imgcat](https://iterm2.com/documentation-images.html)
  - Another install where you'll need to put the script in your PATH directly.

That's it! See y'all online.
