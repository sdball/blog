Howdy ya'll. As much as we'd prefer to just deal with nicely formatted data; the
real world sometimes requires that we parse weird datetime strings into actual
DateTime objects. Today's article is all about how to parse dates and times from
arbitrary strings using the powerful method `strptime`.

<!-- more -->

Using `DateTime.strptime` we can turn crazy data like "07-FEB-12
03.39.14.490227" into actual DateTime objects. Seriously. It's actually
possible, and we won't even need to break out the ol' regular expressions. Let's
look at the basics.

``` ruby
require 'date'

# datetime strings don't really get more basic than this
date_string = '2012-02-09 20:05:33'

# -- using DateTime.parse ----------------
# This string can actually be parsed using the .parse method
# Always try throwing .parse at a datetime string.
# If it can puzzle out the format: you win.
datetime = DateTime.parse(date_string)
puts datetime
# >> 2012-02-09T20:05:33+00:00

# -- using DateTime.strptime ----------------
puts DateTime.strptime(date_string, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
# >> 2012-02-09T20:05:33+00:00
```

See that? We got the same DateTime object using strptime that we got using
parse. Right on! But what the heck did we just do?

The strptime method takes two arguments: the date/time string to parse, and the
date format pattern. The date format pattern is a set of rules for describing
all the different pieces of a date/time that we could possibly find within the
string representation of a date.

The date format pieces are standard bits of computing lore. I never remember
what they are and I always confuse `%m` (the month as a number, e.g. 2) and `%M`
(the minute of the hour, e.g. 2). Oh dates, you're so ambiguous. Ruby Dock has a great
[time formatter reference](http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/date/rdoc/DateTime.html#method-i-strftime)
as part of the strftime method reference.

In the example above, we use:

- %Y : the four digit year
- %m : the month as an integer with a leading zero
- %d : the day of the month as an integer with a leading zero
- %H : the hour of the day (24 hour style, 0-23)
- %M : the minute of the hour with leading zero
- %S : the second of the minute with leading zero

The real trick to parsing with strptime is just knowing that there is a
date/time formatter for just about any date string.

So let's tackle our challenge: 07-FEB-12 03.39.14.490227

What is that? .490227? Ugh. Let's try throwing .parse at it.

``` ruby
puts DateTime.parse('07-FEB-12 03.39.14.490227')
# >> 2012-02-07T00:00:00+00:00
```

Oookay, `.parse` was able to puzzle out the date; but not the time. Time to dig
through the formatting docs.

``` ruby
# 07-FEB-12 03.39.14.490227

# Let's break it down!

# 07 : day of the month
#  %d

# FEB : month as a three character string
#  %b

# 12 : the year as a two digit number (hey Y2K)
#  %y

# Time to check our work
puts DateTime.strptime('07-FEB-12', '%d-%b-%y')
# >> 2012-02-07T00:00:00+00:00

# Perfect.

# 03.39.14.490227 ಠ_ಠ
# We'll have to just make some guesses here.

# 03 : hours, probably 0-23 since there's no AM/PM
#  %H

# 39 : minutes
#  %M

# 14 : seconds
#  %S

# 490227 : nanoseconds?
#  %N

# let's apply our guesses
puts DateTime.strptime('07-FEB-12 03.39.14.490227', '%d-%b-%y %H.%M.%S.%N')
# >> 2012-02-07T03:39:14+00:00
```

Alright! An actual DateTime object that looks like it's gotten at least pretty
close to the intention of this weird date/time string.

Parsing date/time strings into structured DateTime objects is one of those
tedious tasks. It's always a little frustrating to go through this process
because we know that in almost all cases the string we are working hard to put
into a structured DateTime came out of a structured DateTime object somewhere in
its history. Thankfully Ruby provides us with some good functions to make it as
easy as possible.
