Ever added a 'belongs_to' or 'has_many' to a model in Rails? Did you remember to
add the database index? Find out why you should and how it's done in this guest
article by [yodatravis](https://github.com/yodatravis).

If you are looking to increase the performance of your data driven web
application, the answer may be as simple as adding an index to the correct
column of your database table.

A database index is exactly what it sounds like. If you think of the index at
the back of a reference book: a quickly searchable list of pointers to get to
the actual data. Without an index, a database query might have to look at every
row in your database table to find the correct result.

If you find that a SQL query is causing a performance problem and it contains a
where clause or a join then adding an index will greatly speed it up.

## A basic example: searching a table for data

Let's say you are routinely querying your users table.

``` ruby
User.where(:email => current_user.email)
```

Rails automatically adds an index to the id field of a database table, but in
this case we're asking it to find a row based on another piece of data. If you
do that often enough you should almost certainly add an index for that data.

``` ruby
# a migration to index to the users email column
class AddEmailIndexToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_index :users, :email, :unique => true
  end
end
```

## Joining tables

Another classic example of needing to add an index to increase performance is
when you are joining database tables on two unindexed strings. For instance: all
users joined by email address to a table of invitations.

``` ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :order_invites, :foreign_key => 'email', :primary_key => 'email'
end
```

If either the Users or Invitations table has a large number of rows this query
will not perform well because the database is having to scan every record in the
invitations table to check for a match against the email from the users table.

This is easily fixed by adding an index to the email column on the invitations
table.

```ruby
class AddEmailIndexToInvitations < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_index :invitations, :email
  end
end
```

Now, instead of having to go through every row in the invitations table, the
database can just look up the email in the index and go right to the row we care
about.

## How indexes actually work

When a database is told to keep an index on a column, an ordered list (a binary
tree technically) is created that gives the database a faster way to search for
certain values in that column. If you were told to look through a shuffled deck
of cards to find all the Jacks you would have to look at each card until you
find them (close to 52 card views). However if that deck was indexed by card
value (Ace, 2, 3, ... King) then you could quickly move to where the Jacks
should be and find all four of them (let's say 4 or 5 card views). This
performance gain is significantly magnified when your table has large numbers of
rows.

## When not to use indexes

By now, you might be thinking: why not just add an index to every database table
column? Don't do that.

There is a performance hit with indexes. Although select queries can be
significantly faster, inserts and updates are marginally slower because there is
overhead in maintaining the index. However the small impact (milliseconds)
during an insert is usually a small price to pay for what could be seconds (or
even minutes) saved on certain queries.

## Rails 3.2 helps to identify where you need indexes

Rails 3.2 introduces the
[automated explain plan](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2011/12/6/what-s-new-in-edge-rails-explain).
By default, queries that take longer than 0.5 secs will trigger an explain on the
query. The rails development log will automatically contain a warning and you
will see a database explain plan in the output.

The next time this happens to you, stop and think, "Maybe I need an index."
