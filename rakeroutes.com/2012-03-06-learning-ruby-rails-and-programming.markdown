Programming. You can always do it better. There's always someone on the horizon
that you're aspiring towards. It's the best thing about this career: to learn is
to succeed.

Today I'm sharing a bunch of the resources I use to continually retain and
expand my programming knowledge. Yes, it's the blogging equivalent of a clips
episode.

<!-- more -->

## Ruby

- [Code School - TryRuby](http://tryruby.org/) : "Got 15 minutes? Give Ruby a shot right now!" Code School
  lessons are all pretty much superb.

- [The Ruby Game](http://www.therubygame.com/) : submit code via the website to
  try and solve the weekly challenges. The problem definitions are not too basic
  and you get to submit code for immediate feedback. It's pretty fun to see just
  how close to can get to the shortest or fastest rankings. Unfortunately it hasn't
  been updated in a while.

- [Ruby Monk](http://rubymonk.com/) : a great interactive tutorial of the basics
  of Ruby. It's a great series that starts to get into some good stuff, but is
  still incomplete.

- [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/) : a meditation on Ruby and Test Driven
  Development. If you're like me, you'd rather clone a git repo than unpack a
  zip file. Here's the [Ruby Koans on Github](https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans).
  If you are new to either Ruby or TDD these are just great. I periodically go
  through them as a kind of code meditation.

  `git clone https://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans`

- [Ruby Warrior](https://github.com/ryanb/ruby-warrior) : a game to teach both
  Ruby and artificial intelligence. I haven't gone completely through this one,
  but what I've seen has been a lot of fun.

- [Ruby Kickstart](https://github.com/JoshCheek/ruby-kickstart) : a series of
  challenge sessions to teach Ruby concepts. It's a little bit dated and rough
  around the edges, but if you clone the github project you'll get a nicely
  structured set of incremental Ruby challenges designed in a TDD progression.
  It has a [companion website](http://ruby-kickstart.com/)
  with quizzes and tutorial videos, but the real goodness is in the github
  project.

- [Hackety Hack](http://hackety.com/) : Does that name sound familiar? It
  should. If it doesn't, then click the link and see what you've been missing.

## Rails

- [Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/) :
  Don't know Rails? Start here. You will learn git, heroku, TDD, and Rails via a
  fantastic guide. Know Rails? Periodically refresh your skills by going through
  this guide. He's going through and making a full update for Rails 3.2, nice!

- [RailsCasts](http://railscasts.com/) : I don't think there's a Rails
  programmer out there who doesn't owe Ryan Bates. His RailsCasts web series are
  simply the definitive standard by which all other Rails screencasts are
  judged. If you're new to Rails and want to quickly get something up, running,
  and looking pretty: check out his
  [Twitter Bootstrap Basics](http://railscasts.com/episodes/328-twitter-bootstrap-basics)
  episode and follow along.

- No, seriously. RailsCasts is incredible. I don't think you're quite getting
  it. This guy Ryan Bates puts out high quality video and written tutorials for
  free every single week. If you need to use a gem or technique in Rails, you
  can almost guarantee that there's a RailsCast for it.

- [Destroy all Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog)
  : In this screencast series, Gary Bernhardt walks you through various code
  examples in a conversational manner. It's like learning stuff from a really
  smart coworker who just sat down to show you a few things. The videos cover a
  wide range of programming topics, but lately it's been episodes of building a
  Rails app from scratch. Very nicely done.

- [RailsGuides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/index.html) : These guides serve
  as both excellent references and readable tutorials. I like to periodically
  read through them to keep up to speed with the various aspects of Rails. They're
  also available as a .mobi file so you can read them on a Kindle or device with
  a Kindle App.

## Programming

- [Destroy all Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog)
  : Yep, I'm mentioning DAS twice too. The screencasts are great and Gary covers
  more than just Ruby or Rails. Advanced git, advanced vim, advanced TDD, bash,
  etc. Just great.

- [PeepCode](https://peepcode.com/) : PeepCode is another screencast site that
  covers a wide range of topics: Ruby, git, JavaScript, Backbone, one on one
  sessions with talented developers, and more.

- [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/) : Want to stretch your programming a
  bit? Go through the problems in this collection of mathematical puzzlers. The
  problems increase in difficulty. The puzzles aren't tied to any language but
  meant to test your algorithmic skills.

- [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Main_Page) : A wiki of solutions to
  various programming tasks in multiple languages. Want to compare Erlang syntax
  to Ruby? How about JavaScript and CoffeeScript? Clojure and perl?

- [The Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/) : Sure it's python, but
  it's also an interesting puzzle. It's been a while since I went through it;
  I wonder if it would work with Ruby&hellip;.

- [CodingBat](http://codingbat.com/) : a Java/Python code practice site. The
  puzzles are all pretty basic, but it's a fun way to pass a few minutes and
  keep your programming muscles limber.

- [Chris's Wiki](http://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/) : Chris Siebenmann is
  a unix sysadmin and python coder. His blog is a fantastic collection of
  insights, observations, and tips on topics ranging from deep Solaris
  configuration to the unix command line to general programming. No matter your
  field, it's a good read.

- [Hackety Hack](http://hackety.com/) : You say you want to learn how to program
  but don't know where to start? Start here. Seriously. You will learn the
  fundamentals and have silly fun doing it. You can even share the programs you
  write with other Hackety users.
