Sorry that Rake Routes has been silent these past weeks. All at once I've been busy with a couple of other projects:

- a new job with the fine folks at [PhishMe](http://phishme.com)
- the birth of our new baby girl. [Aww](/assets/images/marie.jpg)

I'm starting to get things settled into a new routine, so I’m finally carving out time to blog again!

I've got a new post coming soon on getting up to speed on a new git repository. This is useful for when you want start contributing to a new project or you’re starting a new job and want to get the lay of the land. Look for it this week!
